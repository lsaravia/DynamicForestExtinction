The second way is to get dissected. Building highways, cutting forests, and making large agricultural fields lead to the fragmentation of habitats for several species. The most worrying case is when the nonhabitat area is not suitable even for temporary survival (lb¼0). When h decreases below the critical hc, the population is confined to live in enclosures. Each finite subpopulation has a finite lifetime; therefore, extinctions from the habitat patches are inevitable. Having lb¼0, the empty good patches are unreachable for the species. Thus, a larger and larger proportion of the carrying capacity remains unexploited. If h is not far from hc, and lglc then the population can linger in the largest habitat fragments for a long time (Fig. 20.5). Although the equilibrium state is ^n ¼ 0, i.e. global extinction is certain, it may take a long time to reach the equilibrium.

Thethreshold-like nature of extinctions is an important message from percolation theory. All the control parameters, h, f,and l, have their own critical thresholds. (See the caption of Fig. 20.8 for the definition of l in a heterogeneous landscape.) It would be vital to know more about the interdependence of these parameters. Conservation biology should definitely benefit from this kind of information, because management efforts in nature reserves could be targeted to those control parameters which are close to a threshold. In the vicinity of the threshold, even a small management effort can have great effect on the prospects of survival; further away from the threshold, even large efforts are inefficient (see Fig. 20.3)

We used the IFM (Hanski, 1994) to quantify connectivity because this measure represents a key ecological process (range expansion), which incorporates ecological realism (e.g. metapopulation dynamics) and so produces more ecologically‐relevant outcomes compared to simpler approaches. Our results are comparable to those of more standard connectivity metrics (e.g. least‐cost models; see Appendix S4), but our IFM approach enables us to examine whether habitat networks of conservation set‐asides will allow species to colonize and persist over multiple generations (Hodgson et al., 2011). There is a need to develop modelling approaches that assess the resilience of ecological networks and that go beyond classic landscape connectivity estimates and incorporate ecological outcomes (Isaac et al., 2018). Our approach is therefore an improvement on standard connectivity metrics, but does not include parameters such as reproductive strategy or dispersal phase that are often included in more complex Individual Based Models (IBMs; e.g. see Synes et al., 2015), which are more flexible and predictive than IFMs, but also more computationally intensive. More research is needed to better understand the resilience of habitat networks and identify where connectivity losses are most critical.

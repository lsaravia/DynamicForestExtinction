# Dynamic forest extinction models 

* **ContactProcess2SpeciesCompetition.nlogo** A two-species contact model the species can have different birth death rates and dispersal distances. 
 Dispersal is implemented with a power-law distribution. The model could be simulated here:

* **ContactProcessBirdsInsideForest.nlogo** A two-species commensalism model, one species live inside the other, the dynamics of the host (called forest) species is not influenced by the commensal (Called birds)

* **MultipleContactNeutralMigrat.nlogo** A multiple species neutral/hierarchical model described in [1]. The model has three behaviors

	1. A completely neutral model, where species disperse and if the site is occupied the individual dies
	2. A completely neutral model, where species disperse to empty sites if they are available 
	3. A neutral hierarchical model where species with a higher number replace species lower number species with a given rate. 

	Another feature is a fragmentation button that adds degraded sites that cannot be colonized.  

	There is a version without video extension that is identical to the full version but it can be used with netlogoweb **MultipleContactNeutralMigratNoVid.nlogo**:

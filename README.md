# Dynamic forest extinction models 

* **ContactProcess2SpeciesCompetition.nlogo** A two species contact model the species can have different birth death rates and dispersal distances. 
 Dispersal is implemented with a power-law distribution. The model could be simulated here:

* **ContactProcessBirdsInsideForest.nlogo** A two species comensalism model, one species live inside the other, the dynamics of the host (called forest) species is not influenced by the comensal (Called birds)
